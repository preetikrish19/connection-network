<p>Concepts are an extension to the templates feature provided by the C++ programming language. Concepts are named Boolean predicates on template parameters, evaluated at compile time. A concept may be associated with a template (class template, function template, or member function of a class template), in which case it serves as a constraint: it limits the set of arguments that are accepted as template parameters.

Originally dating back to suggestions for C++11, the original concepts specification has been revised multiple times before now formally being a required part of C++20.</p>
